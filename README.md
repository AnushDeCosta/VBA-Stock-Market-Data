## Introduction
This Analytical exercise is centered on developing a VBA script that iterates through stock data and generates an output report. The task involved creating a new repository named VBA-StockMarketAnalysis, reading the stock_data.xlsx file, and designing the script to provide the following information:

- The ticker symbol
- Yearly change from the opening price at the start of a specific year to the closing price at the end of that year
- The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year
- The total stock volume of the stock

## Additional Task:
The task also involved incorporating a feature to the script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume".

## Conclusion
While these issues raised some queries, the overall challenge was an excellent exercise in harnessing the power of VBA to automate stock data analysis

## Tools
