        The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

        The total stock volume of the stock.

    Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume".


Main Issues Faced

    Under Requirements\Conditional Formatting (20 points) - It is stated:
        Conditional formatting is applied correctly and appropriately to the percent change column (10 points) But the Sample images have only the "Yearly Change" column formated
        In the Rubric under the "Conditional Formatting" section it is stated - âœ“ Conditional formatting is applied correctly and appropriately to the yearly change "and/ or" percent change columns
            Therefore is it ok to just do "Yearly Changes"?
